# Machine-learning-to-predict-customer-churn-of-a-telecommunications-company

In this work project we propose to develop and deploy a predictive model for customer churn prediction in the telecommunications industry to proactively identify potential churners, allowing the company to implement targeted retention strategies and reduce customer attrition, following the CRISP-DM methodology.

Several classification ML algorithms including Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, Bagging, Random Forest and NNC were used, and then evaluated for performance with metrics like precision, accuracy, f-measure, and recall. These results are then verified using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves properly and systematically.
